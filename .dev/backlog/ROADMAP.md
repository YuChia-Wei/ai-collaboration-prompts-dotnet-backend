## Usage Contract

Read this file before planning or resuming a post-v0.4.0 release.

- This roadmap owns release horizons, release-level state, activation gates, and workflow handoffs.
- Individual backlog items own candidate work and their target/completed/published release metadata.
- Execution workflows own task progress, validation evidence, commits, and publication checkpoints.
- Open the planning workflow only when decision rationale or evidence details are needed.

## Release Horizons

| Version | State | Required | Objective | Activation Gate | Workflow |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `v0.4.1` | `published` | yes | Restore only the published package upgrade and downstream-validation contracts through `PKG-001` and `PKG-002`. | Completed at immutable tag `v0.4.1`; hosted run `29650583394` and downloaded assets passed validation. | [`2026-07-18-v0-4-1-release-publication`](../workflows/2026-07-18-v0-4-1-release-publication/workflow.yaml) |

| `v0.7.0` | `conditional` | no | Retire legacy skill identifiers only when downstream migration evidence supports removal, and consider historical-evidence archive migration only through a separately approved successor to `SIMPL-001`. | Demonstrate adoption of `ai-context-init`; satisfy the archive evidence, retention, manifest, redirect, validator, and migration preconditions; prove that indexes and routing alone cannot deliver the measured benefit. | not created |

## Release Gate Semantics

- A `release-blocker` is required implementation and evidence. The release
  cannot enter publication while the item is unresolved.
- A `disposition-gate` requires an explicit retained decision before release
  closure. The result may be implement, retain, defer to a named horizon, or
  reject; an unreviewed or silently dropped item fails the gate.
- An `activation-gate` must be satisfied before the named implementation work
  begins.
- These gates control completeness and decision visibility. They do not impose
  a deadline, force a version split, or create artificial time pressure.

| Version | Release Blockers | Disposition Gates | Activation Dependencies |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `v0.4.2` | `R042-001`, `R042-002`, `R042-003`, `R042-004`, `R042-005` | Any selected correction that would add a schema, required validation or CI route, remove a published path, or intentionally change pass/fail semantics must stop and move to an explicit v0.5.0 item. | v0.4.1 publication and registry closeout are complete. |
| `v0.5.0` | `PKG-003`, `SAG-001`, `ENF-001`, `TOOL-001`, `LANG-001`, `REL-001`, `REL-002`, `HANDOFF-001` | `GOV-001`, `CAP-001`, `VAL-001` | R042-005 is closed; v0.4.2 workflow, independent verification, local release evidence, public Release body, and final version state are reconciled. |
| `v0.6.0` | `DIST-001`, `CUST-001`, `DEVWF-002`, `CI-001`, `CI-002`, `CFG-001`, `SKILL-001` | `SIMPL-001`; any legacy identifier retirement remains conditional and cannot be silently included. | `EVAL-001`, v0.5.0 completion, `.dev/ai-context/provenance.yaml`, `.dev/ai-context/customizations.yaml`, and the approved `software-development-orchestrator` plus `ai-context-init` compatibility transitions. |
| `v0.7.0` | none assigned | A historical archive migration and legacy identifier retirement each require explicit successor work rather than silent inclusion. | Completed `SIMPL-001` disposition, measured benefit, archive preconditions, and downstream compatibility evidence. |

`DEVWF-001`, `UPG-001`, `STD-001`, and `OBS-001` remain independent unassigned
decisions. None is a hidden v0.6.0 blocker. Standards or dev-workflow schema
changes may receive a dedicated release after deliberation instead of being
forced into an existing horizon. Actual WorkService upgrade execution belongs
to its target repository rather than this source roadmap.

## v0.6.0 Product And Distribution Definition

`DIST-001` is a v0.6.0 release blocker by owner decision on 2026-07-23. It
defines what the release delivers before package bytes, CI gates, or
simplification are treated as complete.

The current approved product direction has four layers:

1. a mandatory software-development core covering requirements, specifications,
   problem framing, DDD and architecture, test design, implementation, review,
   target-aware unit/integration test execution, selectable compliance
   validation, and `.dev/workflows/` lifecycle records;
2. a mandatory AI-context lifecycle core covering initialization, audit,
   target-facing governance, upgrade, provenance, customization reconciliation,
   and post-upgrade verification;
3. optional providers, beginning with repository backlog storage while allowing
   Azure DevOps, Jira, GitHub Issues/Projects, another tracker, or no repository
   backlog provider; and
4. source-only package build, publication, finalization, registry, test, and
   historical instance surfaces.

The approved model is one versioned componentized release. New installations
do not enable the repository-backlog provider unless selected; existing targets
preserve it and record the selection. Installed component identity belongs in
`.dev/ai-context/provenance.yaml`; semantic customization identity belongs in
the referenced `.dev/ai-context/customizations.yaml` ledger. Exact schemas,
migrations, and downstream fixtures remain implementation design work. Future
publication as a Python CLI
or package-registry tool is retained as deferred exploration and is not a
v0.6.0 gate.

## Repository Configuration Release Classification

`CFG-001` is assigned to v0.6.0 and will execute with `SKILL-001`. It records
Proposed `ADR-001`: source-root `.editorconfig` and
`.gitattributes` should be owned separately from downstream public-root seed
templates, and only explicitly classified immutable external originals should
receive byte-preserving Git treatment. The current per-evidence attribute is a
tactical fix, not the proposed canonical placement.

ADR acceptance, revision, or rejection remains an explicit implementation gate.
The release assignment does not pre-approve the Proposed ADR, but it closes the
former v0.5.1-versus-v0.6.0 decision.

## GitHub Workflow Review Boundary

`CI-002` records the comprehensive review of GitHub workflow triggers,
responsibilities, lifecycle ownership, duplication, concurrency, and runner
cost. PR #6 applies only the immediate correction: general Governance retains
release-tooling unit tests but no longer executes a hardcoded candidate or
finalization phase when governed documentation such as `.dev/backlog/**`
changes.

The broad backlog trigger remains intentional because a backlog change may
also alter its index, roadmap assignment, workflow references, or release
governance contract. Narrowing it to selected filenames would make valid new
items easy to omit and would not correct the lifecycle-ownership defect that
caused the failure.

The full review is assigned to v0.6.0 and combines with `CI-001` as one
release-engineering workstream by owner decision. It must reuse the short-term
regression boundary, avoid duplicating the Node.js 24 action migration, and
enforce the `DIST-001` component and release lifecycle matrix.

## Current Release Evidence

The first governed downstream v0.4.0 upgrade supplied newer and more direct
release evidence than the earlier planning source:

1. `dotnet-mq-arch-lab@2eeddf392ca79deb4407c47d13ad53178015ba90`
   completed the progressive v0.1.0 to v0.3.0 to v0.4.0 upgrade and retained
   workflow plus assessment evidence.
2. `PKG-001` proves that the published guide requires the v0.3.0 manifest while
   the tagged builder emits a clean-install-only `migration.yaml`; this blocks
   the advertised upgrade path.
3. `PKG-002` proves that the package includes and selects source-release tests
   whose Git history, release registry, or builder module is excluded
   downstream.
4. Both are patch-compatible defect corrections unless implementation requires
   a new schema, new required validation contract, or published-path removal.
   Such expansion must stop for v0.5.0 reclassification.
5. The historical assessment and independent Fable 5 plan remain valid planning
   inputs, but their general content corrections no longer precede these
   observed release failures.
6. By user decision, every correction originally targeted to v0.4.1 moves to
   required v0.4.2 work; the independently authored source plan is retained
   unchanged as historical planning input.
7. Migration schema 1.0.0 remains single-source in v0.4.1. `PKG-003` owns the
   v0.5.0 multi-source contract, including direct v0.4.0-to-v0.5.0 validation
   against the retained `dotnet-mq-arch-lab` consumer.
8. v0.4.2 is genuinely published from
   `f474c3b058cb9f89f93929e0732fc1f276422dd9`. `R042-005` repaired the
   post-publication finalization and, after explicit authorization, replaced
   and verified the public Release body without moving the final tag or
   changing the four published assets.
9. `ASM-20260720-001` preserves the independent Fable 5 review and confirms
   its release-finalization findings with repository-native evidence.

## Approved 2026-07-19 Gate Revision

1. v0.5.0 may not start before v0.4.2 is complete.
2. v0.4.2 contains only patch-compatible corrections. Its release workflow must
   stop and reclassify work when the smallest coherent change needs a new
   schema, required validator or CI route, published-path removal, or intentional
   pass/fail semantic change.
3. The minimum portability evidence for v0.4.2 is Windows Git Bash plus hosted
   Ubuntu. macOS requires a separately arranged environment and remains
   explicitly unverified; no artifact may imply macOS execution.
4. `TOOL-001` and `LANG-001` are v0.5.0 release blockers, not optional cleanup
   or disposition-only work.
5. Model-in-the-loop evaluation is a v0.6.0 release-side activation gate.
   Routine downstream installs and upgrades remain deterministic and model-free
   by default.
6. Cold-start release execution and cross-model or fresh-session state
   alignment are v0.5.0 release blockers under `REL-001` and `HANDOFF-001`.
   Form-compliant prose is not sufficient evidence of a validation run.
7. On 2026-07-22 the owner-arranged Fable 5 host completed the previously
   deferred macOS evidence at `main@9ac40bee`: native bash 3.2.57 quick and
   critical gates both passed 33/33. `ASM-20260722-003` preserves the raw
   report and separately reproduces its `AI_CONTEXT_PYTHON` fixture leak; the
   receiving host must not recast the attributed run as a universal platform
   or provider-runtime guarantee.

## Backlog Release Targets

The backlog index is the quick catalog for target, completion, and publication
versions. Current assignments:

- `v0.4.1`: `PKG-001` and `PKG-002` were completed and published in
  `REL-v0.4.1`.
- `v0.4.2`: corrections `R042-001` through `R042-004` are published;
  `R042-005` owns post-tag finalization and keeps `published_in` unset because
  the hotfix is not part of the immutable v0.4.2 tree.
- `v0.5.0`: `PKG-003`, `SAG-001`, `ENF-001`, `TOOL-001`, `LANG-001`,
  `REL-001`, `REL-002`, `HANDOFF-001`, `GOV-001`, `CAP-001`, and `VAL-001`
  were completed and published in `REL-v0.5.0`.
- `v0.6.0`: `DIST-001` owns the release product and component definition;
  `CUST-001` owns the semantic customization ledger and four-skill lifecycle;
  `DEVWF-002` owns high-level orchestrator activation, approval pauses,
  stage-batched commit evidence, target-aware test execution, selectable spec
  compliance, conditional specialized tests, and end-to-end closeout;
  `EVAL-001` is the activation gate for `SKILL-001`, which owns coordinated
  compatible transitions from `repo-structure-sync` to `ai-context-init` and
  from `dev-workflow` to `software-development-orchestrator`;
  `CFG-001` executes with that taxonomy/configuration workstream; `SIMPL-001`
  owns measured simplification disposition; and `CI-001` plus `CI-002` own the
  complete release-automation migration and lifecycle review.
- `v0.7.0`: historical archive migration remains conditional and requires a
  separately approved successor after `SIMPL-001`; it is not implied work.
- `unassigned`: `DEVWF-001` owns optional issue/timeline schema deliberation;
  `UPG-001` owns a reusable legacy-target intake and override-preservation
  packet; `STD-001` owns standards deliberation and release allocation; and
  `OBS-001` remains an independent architecture workflow. None is a mandatory
  closeout gate for an assigned release.
- Resolved `AIC-007` and `CTX-001` through `CTX-003` were first completed and
  published in `v0.1.0`, verified by Git tag ancestry.

## Sub-Agent Runtime Integration Timing

- `v0.4.2`: correct only the existing `context-translator` routing/catalog
  omission. This is a contract-preserving documentation patch and does not
  authorize new adapter semantics or bulk wrapper generation.
- `v0.5.0`: execute `SAG-001` to define dynamic versus runtime-native role
  integration, add exact adapter metadata and parity validation, verify package
  coverage, and record explicit role-by-role promotion decisions. This contract
  is complete: 17 roles remain dynamic and only `context-translator` maps
  exact Codex, Claude, and Copilot adapters.
- `v0.6.0`: consume the stabilized contract during skill-family taxonomy work.
  Taxonomy grouping or renaming does not automatically promote a role to a
  runtime-native adapter.

## AI Behavior Evaluation And Token Cost Boundary

- Deterministic structure and contract checks are the mandatory complete
  baseline and require no model call.
- Model-in-the-loop evaluation runs on release candidates or explicitly
  requested full evaluations. It does not run during a normal downstream
  upgrade.
- The release workflow must approve the model, judge, repetitions, fixture
  sampling, maximum token budget, acceptance threshold, and result retention
  before executing model calls.
- Empty, existing, and copied-template repositories form the minimum fixture
  families. Deterministic coverage applies to the complete declared corpus;
  model evaluation may use an approved representative sample to bound cost.
- Stochastic results are comparative evidence, not a sole oracle. A single
  model pass cannot override deterministic regression failure.

## Simplification, Archive, And Standards Sequencing

`SIMPL-001` distinguishes repository corpus size from context actually loaded
into an agent session. Fable 5's word-count baseline is useful for discovery,
but it does not prove that completed workflows, assessments, or long references
are paid as prompt tokens on every run. v0.6.0 therefore measures representative
runtime, release, handoff, routing, and development sessions before accepting
token-savings claims.

Historical compression is conditional v0.7.0 work for five reasons:

1. completed workflow and assessment records are normally reached through
   indexes or explicit evidence lookup rather than loaded by default;
2. the v0.4.2 incident required historical records to reconstruct tag, run,
   commit, handoff, and finalization truth;
3. stable repository-relative references currently bind backlog, workflow,
   assessment, release, and Git-search evidence;
4. an archive branch or Git history alone is less deterministic for fresh
   agents and external reviewers than file-backed evidence; and
5. indexes or discovery routing may remove most operational noise without
   accepting migration and auditability risk.

v0.6.0 may reduce default discovery while preserving stable files. Moving,
deleting, summarizing, or replacing full historical evidence requires a
separate v0.7.0 item with measured benefit, a retention policy, immutable
manifest/digests, stable summaries and redirects, reference validation,
restore/lookup behavior, and downstream migration evidence.

Standards simplification is not normal token cleanup. Standards are a core
software-development capability of this framework, so `STD-001` remains
unassigned while bounded ChatGPT, Fable 5, and repository-agent discussions are
normalized and reviewed. Only after the accepted doctrine, validator impact,
examples, compatibility, and migration boundaries are understood may the owner
assign it to v0.6.0, v0.7.0, or a dedicated release.

## Next Action

v0.6.0 is published and no successor release is automatically active. Hold an
owner roadmap discussion before assigning a new `current_target`. Keep v0.7.0
conditional, and keep `DEVWF-001`, `UPG-001`, `STD-001`, and `OBS-001`
independently gated unless an explicit decision assigns them. Do not silently
include a future software-delivery orchestrator, historical archive migration,
or legacy identifier retirement in a successor release.
