## Executive Summary

- Overall assessment: **healthy with documented follow-ups**
- Overall score: **9.7/10**
- Decision: **healthy-with-followups; remediation workflow may close**
- Primary strengths: the composed full gate passes with closeout variables exported; 34 first-parent commits pass; active profile truth and fail-closed coverage remain aligned; all tool-owned verification projects pass; no new finding was identified.
- Primary follow-up: `ASM-20260717-001#SVF-002` remains LOW/deferred. The helper is enumerated as deferred but not executed; it is not a release blocker.

The assessed AI-context remediation is ready for governance reconciliation and deterministic v0.4.0 release-candidate/package preparation. This assessment does not authorize tagging, publication, or main-branch integration.

## Scope

### Included AI Context Surfaces

- GATE-003 isolation behavior, profile projections, aggregate runner, shell lifecycle, workflow/assessment/release records, validators, manifests, tool-owned verification projects, and Git history.

### Default Exclusions

- `src/**`, product `tests/**`, product implementation trees, generated/dependency output.

### Additional Exclusions

- `docker-compose/**`, product code review, GitHub Release re-verification, v0.3.0 tag mutation, full Observability design, and downstream clean-room implementation.

### Code Review Handoff

- Requested: `no`
- Paths not scanned: product source and tests
- Recommended skill: not applicable

## Methodology And Evidence

### Pass A: Independent Baseline

- Ran the complete gate in the real closeout environment, inspected nested fixture isolation, profile names/routes, deferred execution semantics, refs, tags, and clean-tree state.

### Pass B: Repository-Aware Skill Review

- Applied auditor evidence, assessment, governance lifecycle, commit, workflow, shell, and release contracts; reconciled every finding from `ASM-20260717-001` and `ASM-20260717-002`.

### Delegation

- Sub-agents used: `yes`, read-only
- Assigned surface: independent composed-gate and ref/tag verification.
- The primary agent independently re-ran focused tests and all material validators.

### Discovery Accelerators

| Tool / generated view | Source revision | Freshness / dirty state | Scope and exclusions | Unsupported relationships | File-backed fallback |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `codebase-memory-mcp` | pre-PROFILE-003 index | stale and excluded affected hidden roots | omitted `.ai/assets`, `.ai/scripts`, `.claude`, examples, tools | links, hidden completeness, runtime selection | not used for conclusions; `rg -uu`, direct reads, validators, Git |

## Strengths

1. With `COMMIT_RANGE` and `WORKFLOW_ID` exported, the full gate passes 21/21 required checks, zero failures, and zero advisories.
2. The focused fail-closed runner suite passes 18/18 in the same environment; the real selected commit check still validates 34 first-parent commits.
3. `SVF-001` remains resolved (profile contract 3/3); analyzers 49/49, validation 2/2, and BuildingBlocks 5/5 pass.
4. `main` and `origin/main` remain `82b88b7`; v0.3.0 remains annotated and peels to `1e782909`; no v0.4.0 tag exists.

## Finding Reconciliation

| Finding | Final result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ASM-20260717-002#FVF-001` | resolved | synthetic fixture isolates closeout variables; focused 18/18 and composed 21/21 pass |
| `ASM-20260717-001#SVF-001` | resolved | canonical active names and `.ai` coverage; profile contract 3/3 |
| `ASM-20260717-001#SVF-002` | deferred, nonblocking | reported as DEFERRED; helper is enumerated but not executed |
| `ASM-20260716-001#VFY-001` through `VFY-006` | resolved | focused/full gates, commit history, rewrite evidence, and registries pass |
| `ASM-20260715-002#AIC-001` through `AIC-014` | resolved or explicitly deferred by approved boundary | workflow evidence and successor assessments reconcile every baseline item |

## Findings

No new findings.

## Baseline And Skill Comparison

### Confirmed

- Both passes confirm the composed gate, profile projection enforcement, history, release registry, and immutable tag/ref boundaries.

### Added By Repository-Aware Review

- Workflow closure may carry `SVF-002` as a named LOW deferral because owner, reason, execution boundary, and next action are explicit.

### Downgraded Or Deferred

- Down-tiered legacy profile examples, clean-room reconstruction, helper retirement, NuGet productization, and full OBS-001 design remain outside the release-blocking set.

### Overturned

- `FVF-001` is overturned by current composed execution evidence.

## Validation

| Check | Result | Evidence / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Focused fail-closed runner | pass | 18/18 with closeout variables exported |
| Full composed gate | pass | 21/21 required, 0 failures, 0 advisories, 4 deferred, 1 N/A |
| Selected workflow range | pass | 34 first-parent commits |
| Profile projection | pass | 3/3 |
| Analyzer/validation/BuildingBlocks | pass | 49/49, 2/2, 5/5 |
| Workflow/assessment/release/disposition/shell | pass | all repository-native validators pass |
| Git state | pass | assessment branch clean; assessed surfaces unchanged |
| Ref/tag invariants | pass | main and v0.3.0 unchanged; no v0.4.0 tag |

### Skipped Validation

- GitHub Release, external publication, product code, downstream clean-room construction, and full OBS-001 design.
- Windows symlink privilege probe remains an isolated environment skip.

## Recommended Action Order

1. Integrate this assessment and close `VERIFY-001` plus the remediation workflow, retaining `SVF-002` as an explicit LOW deferral.
2. Select the immutable release commit and build deterministic package/checksum artifacts.
3. Validate package parity and update the planned release record with release-candidate evidence.
4. Await explicit user authorization for any main merge, v0.4.0 annotated tag, or publication.

## Deferred Items

- `SVF-002` manual helper advice/retirement;
- clean-room reconstruction, NuGet productization, and full Observability design in `OBS-001`;
- downstream product remediation.
