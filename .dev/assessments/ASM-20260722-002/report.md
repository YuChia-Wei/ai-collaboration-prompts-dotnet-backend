## Executive Summary

- Overall assessment: **healthy four-source release candidate with all prior
  cold-start findings resolved**
- Overall score: **9.5/10**
- Decision: **healthy-with-followups**
- Primary strengths: exact v0.4.2 automatic upgrade truth is consistent across
  discovery and machine contracts; the release checkpoint is current and
  repository-verifiable; every active resume surface names one executable next
  action; local and hosted gates pass.
- Primary risks: macOS and unavailable provider-native fixtures remain explicit
  limitations; merge, tag preparation, tag creation, and publication are later
  lifecycle actions and were not performed by this assessment.

No CRITICAL, HIGH, or MEDIUM release-readiness defect remains at the subject.
Persisting this assessment fulfills the planned independent successor gate.
The workflow may proceed to final governance reconciliation and merge
preparation, but this assessment does not authorize a tag or publication.

## Scope

### Included AI Context Surfaces

- Baseline `ASM-20260722-001` and all three selected findings.
- v0.5.0 release discovery, machine record, authored notes, and migration guide.
- Distribution contract and exact four-source upgrade declaration.
- PKG-003 and REL-001 lifecycle wording.
- V050-010 plan, task, evidence, report, checkpoint, and checkpoint registry.
- Read-only Git and current draft-PR hosted checks.

### Default Exclusions

- `src/**`
- `tests/**`, `test/**` outside AI-context validator-contract evidence
- product implementation trees
- generated and dependency trees

### Additional Exclusions

- Tag creation and GitHub Release publication.
- macOS execution.
- Provider-native fixtures unavailable in this environment.

### Code Review Handoff

- Requested: `no`
- Paths not scanned: product source and product tests
- Recommended skill: not applicable

## Methodology And Evidence

### Pass A: Independent Baseline

- Followed release discovery, upgrade provenance, and resume routes as a fresh
  receiver without relying on repository claims of completion.
- Required exact source identity, a current machine-readable checkpoint, one
  executable next action, and explicit separation between candidate,
  publication, and historical evidence.

### Pass B: Repository-Aware Skill Review

- Applied assessment, workflow, handoff, backlog, release, and evidence
  contracts after the fresh-receiver pass.
- Re-ran candidate, workflow, handoff, registry, lifecycle, and focused contract
  validators against the exact subject.
- Compared current files to every finding in `ASM-20260722-001`.

### Delegation

- Sub-agents used: `yes`, one bounded read-only successor verification with a
  second follow-up after the checkpoint resume refresh.
- Assigned surfaces: AIC-001 through AIC-003 and new release-readiness blockers.
- The main auditor verified exact subject state and hosted results and owns this
  report.

### Discovery Accelerators

| Tool / generated view | Source revision or input digest | Freshness / dirty state | Scope and exclusions | Unsupported relationships | File-backed fallback |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| None accepted as evidence | `d83f395e5a399f944cb53b87c1f95cd299a4c386` | clean pushed subject | targeted verification allowlist | not applicable | direct Git, files, validators, and read-only GitHub Actions results |

## Repository Context Inventory

| Surface | Files / Size | Audience | Scope | State | Notes |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Release discovery and record | index plus 3 v0.5.0 files | users/maintainers | candidate truth | healthy | four exact automatic sources |
| Distribution contract | README plus schema/profile contracts | agents/tooling | package behavior | healthy | v0.4.2 requires exact inventory |
| Backlog lifecycle | PKG-003 and REL-001 | maintainers/agents | implementation versus release closure | healthy | publication remains null |
| V050-010 handoff | checkpoint plus plan/task/evidence | fresh receivers | executable continuation | healthy | containing commit is current |

## Strengths

1. Release index, release record, distribution README, and migration guide all
   declare v0.3.0, v0.4.0, v0.4.1, and v0.4.2 as exact automatic sources.
2. The v0.4.2 route requires its exact published `metadata/files.yaml` and
   rejects a manifest from any other version.
3. PKG-003 and REL-001 explicitly distinguish implementation resolution from
   V050-010 release-readiness closure and separately owner-authorized
   publication.
4. V050-010 is a `release_handoff: true` checkpoint with the exact REL-owned
   candidate command, passing bounded evidence, attribution preservation, and
   a clean repository-verifiable containing commit.
5. Workflow plan, task, and checkpoint all route the receiver to persisted
   successor verification and final reconciliation; none repeats completed
   implementation or checkpoint work.
6. The current subject passes package-candidate, governance, and Ubuntu hosted
   checks as well as local candidate, workflow, handoff, and release validators.

## Finding Reconciliation

| Baseline Finding | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ASM-20260722-001#AIC-001` | resolved | `.dev/releases/INDEX.MD`, `.ai/distribution/README.md`, `release.yaml`, and `migration-guide.md` agree on four exact automatic sources including v0.4.2 |
| `ASM-20260722-001#AIC-002` | resolved | V050-010 checkpoint repository verification passes; plan, task, and checkpoint expose one current successor-verification action |
| `ASM-20260722-001#AIC-003` | resolved | PKG-003 and REL-001 describe implementation resolution without claiming V050-010 closure or publication; both retain `published_in: null` |
| `ASM-20260722-001#AIC-004` | accepted residual | macOS and unavailable provider-native fixtures remain explicit and do not broaden the support claim |

## Findings

No new CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW defect was found.

## Baseline And Skill Comparison

### Confirmed

- Both passes confirm all selected findings are resolved.
- Both passes confirm the v0.4.2 automatic route is exact, executable, and
  consistently discoverable.
- Both passes confirm no publication has occurred or been authorized.

### Added By Repository-Aware Review

- The exact sanctioned candidate command in the checkpoint matches the
  REL-owned phase contract.
- Repository verification proves the checkpoint's containing commit, branch,
  clean state, attribution, and pinned subject rather than trusting prose.

### Downgraded Or Deferred

- A preflight-only workflow resume lag was corrected before this final subject
  and is no longer a finding.
- macOS and missing provider-native fixtures remain accepted explicit
  limitations.

### Overturned

- No baseline finding was overturned without file-backed correction and
  validator evidence.

## Validation

| Check | Result | Evidence / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Git state | pass | clean pushed subject `d83f395e5a399f944cb53b87c1f95cd299a4c386` |
| Exact candidate state | pass | v0.5.0 candidate phase at subject |
| Release registry | pass | 8 release records |
| Workflow lifecycle | pass | V050-010 is the sole active task |
| V050-010 handoff structure | pass | registered release checkpoint and exact candidate command |
| V050-010 repository verification | pass | current containing commit, branch, clean state, attribution, and pinned ancestor |
| Pinned critical gate | pass | 33/33 required, 0 failed, 0 deferred, 1 N/A at corrected candidate parent |
| Hosted package candidate | pass | run `29880307922`, 23 seconds |
| Hosted governance | pass | run `29880307921`, 16 seconds |
| Hosted Ubuntu quick gate | pass | run `29880307914`, 1 minute 35 seconds |
| Focused contract tests | pass | release-state 15/15, handoff 15/15, lifecycle 6/6, backlog-release 6/6 |

### Skipped Validation

- macOS execution was unavailable.
- Provider-native Copilot and Claude fixture execution was unavailable.
- Tag creation, pre-tag mutation, and public release publication were outside
  this read-only assessment.
- Product code review was excluded.

## Recommended Action Order

1. Commit this assessment without changing audited context.
2. Return to `ai-context-governance`, complete V050-010, and reconcile the
   workflow/report/roadmap to release-ready.
3. Validate the complete workflow commit range and final repository gates.
4. Merge with the governed no-fast-forward strategy and run owner-only pre-tag
   preparation on updated `main`; do not create a tag without separate owner
   authorization.

## Deferred Items

- macOS portability evidence.
- Real provider-native attribution fixtures when interfaces become available.
- `SIMPL-001`, `STD-001`, and conditional archive work at their existing
  separately governed horizons.

### Notes

- The assessment files are not part of the assessed subject.
- The checkpoint's bounded critical evidence pins the corrected candidate
  parent; the current subject additionally passed all three hosted PR gates.
