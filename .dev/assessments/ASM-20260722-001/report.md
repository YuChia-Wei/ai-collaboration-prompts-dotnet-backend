## Executive Summary

- Overall assessment: **four-source package and release mechanics are healthy,
  but the candidate is not release-ready because active discovery and handoff
  surfaces still expose stale three-source and pre-candidate state**
- Overall score: **8.2/10**
- Decision: **remediation-recommended**
- Primary strengths: v0.4.2 is an exact automatic upgrade source alongside
  v0.3.0, v0.4.0, and v0.4.1; deterministic four-source packages pass; local
  release gates pass; and all three hosted PR gates are green at the subject.
- Primary risks: a fresh or lower-cost receiver can still follow the release
  index, distribution README, workflow resume block, or registered handoff
  checkpoint and act on obsolete state.

The release candidate implementation itself is sound. The remaining high
findings are context-control defects at precisely the cold-start and handoff
surfaces intended to prevent another v0.4.2-style execution error. They must be
reconciled and independently reverified before the workflow claims
release-readiness.

## Scope

### Included AI Context Surfaces

- Root collaboration entries and AI-context navigation.
- `.ai/**` distribution, upgrade, runtime, and validation contracts.
- v0.5.0 release registry, authored notes, and migration guide.
- v0.5.0 roadmap, backlog, workflow, task, evidence, and handoff state.
- Current runtime wrappers and hosted governance/release workflows.
- Read-only Git and GitHub Actions evidence for draft PR `#1`.

### Default Exclusions

- `src/**`
- `tests/**`, `test/**` outside AI-context validator-contract evidence
- product implementation trees
- generated and dependency trees

### Additional Exclusions

- Tag creation, GitHub Release publication, and other external mutation.
- macOS execution.
- Provider-native Copilot and Claude fixture execution that is not available in
  the current environment.

### Code Review Handoff

- Requested: `no`
- Paths not scanned: product source and product tests
- Recommended skill: not applicable

## Methodology And Evidence

### Pass A: Independent Baseline

- Treated repository declarations as claims rather than as the scoring rubric.
- Followed active discovery and cold-start routes as a fresh maintainer or
  lower-cost agent would encounter them.
- Required one coherent candidate identity, executable upgrade provenance,
  current resume state, explicit authority boundaries, and reproducible gates.
- Confirmed the authoritative four-source release contract, then found stale
  active discovery and resume surfaces that contradict it.

### Pass B: Repository-Aware Skill Review

- Applied assessment, workflow, handoff, release, backlog, language, wrapper,
  and evidence policies after the independent baseline was recorded.
- Verified exact candidate state, all release records, deterministic packaging,
  the complete critical gate, and same-revision hosted PR evidence.
- Kept release publication and tag creation outside this read-only assessment.

### Delegation

- Sub-agents used: `yes`, three bounded read-only slices.
- Assigned surfaces: independent baseline/navigation; runtime/package/release
  contracts; governance/backlog/handoff lifecycle.
- The main auditor reconciled duplicate findings, verified high-severity file
  evidence, and owns this report.

### Discovery Accelerators

| Tool / generated view | Source revision or input digest | Freshness / dirty state | Scope and exclusions | Unsupported relationships | File-backed fallback |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| None accepted as evidence | `ef148472bb2e47b058693a1ab5e28dcb99e5ba32` | clean committed subject | targeted AI-context and governance allowlist | not applicable | direct Git, files, validators, package builds, and read-only GitHub Actions results |

## Repository Context Inventory

| Surface | Files / Size | Audience | Scope | State | Notes |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Root entries | 5 tracked files | humans/agents | identity and routing | healthy | bilingual entry ownership remains validated |
| `.ai/**` | 259 tracked files | agents/tooling | reusable context and distribution | healthy with one stale README statement | package mechanics and validators pass |
| `.dev/**` | 720 tracked files | humans/agents | governance and project truth | two active stale surfaces | release record itself is coherent |
| Runtime and GitHub adapters | 41 tracked files | runtime/hosted CI | wrappers, agents, and CI | healthy | hosted read-only boundaries pass |
| v0.5.0 release/workflow | 3 release files; 26 workflow files | maintainers/agents | candidate execution | remediation required | handoff checkpoint is behind the candidate |

## Strengths

1. `.dev/releases/v0.5.0/release.yaml` declares v0.3.0, v0.4.0, v0.4.1,
   and v0.4.2 in both reconciliation and automatic-upgrade source lists.
2. The migration guide gives v0.4.2 an exact `metadata/files.yaml` plus
   `--previous-version 0.4.2` route and rejects cross-version provenance.
3. Four real extracted-source upgrades preserve target-owned truth and local
   managed overrides; two subject-pinned builds are byte-identical and pass
   ZIP/tar.gz parity validation.
4. The exact candidate-state validator passes on the clean subject and the
   complete critical gate passes 33/33 with no failures or deferrals.
5. Hosted candidate run `29878635973`, governance run `29878635862`, and
   Ubuntu quick-gate run `29878635890` all pass at the same candidate revision.
6. Tag creation remains user-owned and publication automation validates an
   annotated tag, draft assets, release body, and downloaded artifacts without
   creating or moving Git refs.
7. Fable 5 feedback remains attributed external evidence normalized through a
   repo-native assessment; standards simplification and historical archiving
   retain their separately approved v0.6.0/v0.7.0 decision boundaries.

## Findings

| ID | Severity | Finding | Evidence | Impact | Recommendation | Owner / Next Skill |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AIC-001 | HIGH | Active release discovery contradicts the validated four-source contract. | `.dev/releases/INDEX.MD:18` calls v0.5.0 planned, lists only v0.3.0/v0.4.0/v0.4.1, and leaves v0.4.2 manual; `.ai/distribution/README.md:33` repeats the three-source set, while `.dev/releases/v0.5.0/release.yaml:28-38` and `migration-guide.md:52-56` make v0.4.2 exact and automatic. | A fresh receiver can choose manual reconciliation or reject the owner-approved v0.4.2 path. | Reconcile both discovery surfaces to the validated four-source candidate while retaining unpublished status. | `ai-context-governance` |
| AIC-002 | HIGH | The active resume block and only registered handoff checkpoint predate the current candidate. | `workflow-plan.md:125-140` still instructs committing work already committed; `handoff-checkpoints/V050-008.yaml:2-16,54` pins V050-008 and is not a release handoff. Repository verification rejects it at current HEAD. | A fresh session or lower-cost model can duplicate work, resume from the wrong base, or miss the candidate phase gate. | Refresh the plan and add a V050-010 release-candidate checkpoint pinned through its containing commit, with exact candidate and hosted evidence plus one next action. | `ai-context-governance` |
| AIC-003 | MEDIUM | PKG-003 and REL-001 are marked resolved before their stated V050-010 release-gate evidence is closed. | `PKG-003.yaml:5`, `REL-001.yaml:5,29`, and `tasks/V050-010.json:21-25`. | Backlog consumers can conflate implementation-complete with release-gate-complete even though workflow and release records still fail closed. | Keep them active until V050-010 closes, or explicitly distinguish implementation resolution from release-gate resolution. | `ai-context-governance` |
| AIC-004 | LOW | macOS and one Windows symlink-privilege path remain unverified. | v0.5.0 release notes retain the platform limitation; package-apply suite reports one environment skip. | Portability evidence is strong for Windows Git Bash and hosted Ubuntu but not universal. | Preserve the limitation as an explicit non-blocking residual; do not infer macOS coverage. | future portability work |

## Baseline And Skill Comparison

### Confirmed

- Both passes confirm the four-source implementation and v0.4.2 exact automatic
  route are correct.
- Both passes identify stale active discovery or handoff state as the primary
  release-readiness risk.
- Both passes confirm publication is intentionally absent and user-owned.

### Added By Repository-Aware Review

- Repository handoff validation proves the V050-008 checkpoint cannot serve as
  a current fresh-session checkpoint.
- Backlog resolution wording is structurally valid but semantically ahead of
  the release-gate lifecycle.
- Hosted governance boundaries and deterministic four-source packaging pass.

### Downgraded Or Deferred

- Lack of macOS execution is LOW and non-blocking because it is explicit and no
  broader support claim is made.
- Unavailable provider-native fixtures remain accepted limitations rather than
  fabricated evidence.
- Standards simplification stays a separate discussion-intensive version
  decision; historical archiving remains a conditional v0.7.0 successor.

### Overturned

- No defect was reproduced in the v0.4.2 automatic upgrade implementation.
- The initial hosted candidate failure was not a package defect; the workflow's
  temporary-output correction is validated by a passing rerun.

## Validation

| Check | Result | Evidence / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Git state | pass | clean pushed subject `ef148472bb2e47b058693a1ab5e28dcb99e5ba32` |
| Exact candidate state | pass | v0.5.0 candidate phase, exact branch and subject |
| Complete critical gate | pass | 33/33 required, 0 failed, 0 deferred, 1 N/A |
| Release registry | pass | 8 release records |
| Four-source extracted upgrades | pass | v0.3.0, v0.4.0, v0.4.1, and v0.4.2 |
| Deterministic package parity | pass | two subject-pinned builds; ZIP/tar.gz and cross-build bytes match |
| Hosted package candidate | pass | run `29878635973`, 27 seconds |
| Hosted governance | pass | run `29878635862`, 10 seconds |
| Hosted Ubuntu quick gate | pass | run `29878635890`, 1 minute 35 seconds |
| Workflow lifecycle metadata | pass | V050-001 through V050-009 completed; V050-010 is the sole active task |
| Current registered handoff | fail as expected | V050-008 containing commit is not current HEAD and is not a release handoff |

### Skipped Validation

- macOS execution was unavailable.
- Provider-native Copilot and Claude fixtures were not available; no result was
  invented.
- Tag creation and public release mutation were outside the assessment and
  remain separately authorized.
- Product code review was excluded.

## Recommended Action Order

1. Commit this assessment without changing audited context.
2. Reconcile `.dev/releases/INDEX.MD` and `.ai/distribution/README.md` to the
   exact four-source candidate.
3. Refresh the active workflow resume block and create a V050-010
   release-candidate handoff checkpoint with current validation evidence.
4. Reconcile PKG-003 and REL-001 lifecycle wording, then rerun candidate,
   workflow, handoff, release, and complete critical gates.
5. Create a successor verification assessment against the corrected immutable
   candidate; only then claim release-readiness or merge toward owner-only tag
   preparation.

## Deferred Items

- macOS portability evidence.
- Provider-native fixture expansion when real interfaces are available.
- `SIMPL-001` measurements and disposition at v0.6.0.
- A separately approved historical-archive successor no earlier than v0.7.0.
- Detailed `STD-001` discussion and its independently chosen release horizon.
