## Executive Summary

- Overall assessment: the selected v0.4.2 content and tooling corrections are
  coherent, patch-compatible, and locally verified at the pinned revision.
- Overall score: `9.0/10` (provisional until hosted evidence)
- Decision: `healthy-with-followups`
- Primary strengths: current routing inventories align with retained assets;
  canonical doctrine now controls positive examples; lifecycle and install
  guidance no longer present stale truth; portability fixes preserve the
  existing required command inventory and fail-closed behavior.
- Primary risk: the aggregate gate has not been executed on hosted Ubuntu, so
  the cross-platform portion of `R042-004` remains unverified.

## Scope

### Included AI Context Surfaces

- Root collaboration and identity entries.
- `.ai/**` canonical context, skill, sub-agent, routing, template, distribution,
  and validator surfaces.
- `.dev/**` governance, standards, guides, requirements, specs, backlog,
  assessment, and workflow surfaces.
- `.agents/**` and `.claude/**` runtime wrappers.
- `.github/workflows/**` only for current hosted-evidence route inspection.

### Default Exclusions

- `src/**`
- `tests/**`, `test/**`
- product implementation trees
- generated and dependency trees

### Additional Exclusions

- `tools/**` implementation was not reviewed; only aggregate-gate result
  summaries were consumed as execution evidence.
- Historical assessment and workflow prose was not treated as current truth
  unless an active locator, index, or current scan supplied the relationship.

### Code Review Handoff

- Requested: `no`
- Paths not scanned: product source/test trees and validator implementation
  internals outside the AI-context audit boundary.
- Recommended skill: `code-reviewer` only if a later request targets .NET
  implementation quality.

## Methodology And Evidence

### Pass A: Independent Baseline

- Evidence used: the pinned Git tree, root entries, active indexes, canonical
  versus runtime inventories, selected standards/examples, retained historical
  labels, runner/tool bootstrap, workflow discovery, and commit history.
- Checks performed: truth-boundary and navigation review; canonical ownership;
  positive-versus-negative doctrine framing; historical/planned-content
  labeling; runtime portability; fail-closed behavior; lifecycle clarity.
- Result: no active content contradiction or unsafe path was reproduced. The
  only material uncertainty was the absence of hosted Ubuntu execution.

### Pass B: Repository-Aware Skill Review

- Policies and skills used: `ai-context-auditor`,
  `AI-CONTEXT-BOUNDARY`, assessment artifact policy, workflow artifact policy,
  language policy, version governance, shell asset contract, and the active
  v0.4.2 patch-impact gate.
- Checks performed: selected `ASM-20260717-004` finding reconciliation;
  routing and wrapper parity; retained-template disposition; requirement
  outcomes; literal runner-command parity; workflow and commit policy.
- Result: the selected corrections remain within patch scope. New semantic
  wrapper validation, governance CI, physical template retirement, runtime
  adapter promotion, and runner redesign correctly remain v0.5.0 work.

### Delegation

- Sub-agents used: `no`
- Assigned surfaces: none; the main auditor retained evidence synthesis and
  verification.

### Discovery Accelerators

| Tool / generated view | Source revision or input digest | Freshness / dirty state | Scope and exclusions | Unsupported relationships | File-backed fallback |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| None | pinned Git tree | clean subject revision | AI context allowlist; product code excluded | not applicable | direct `git show`, `git grep`, validators, and test execution |

## Repository Context Inventory

| Surface | Files / Size | Audience | Scope | State | Notes |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Root entries | 5 files | human and agent | identity, precedence, routing | active | bilingual ownership and thin Claude entry validated |
| `.ai/**` | 239 tracked files | agent/runtime | canonical assets, distribution, tooling | active plus labeled compatibility | 14 canonical skills reported by validator |
| `.dev/**` | 640 tracked files | human/governance | standards, guides, history, lifecycle | active plus indexed history | workflow and assessment locators own lifecycle |
| Runtime wrappers | 17 `.agents` + 17 `.claude` files | runtime | thin current projections | active | selected wrapper identity drift not reproduced |

## Strengths

1. The roadmap gate prevents v0.5.0 activation before v0.4.2 completion and
   names minor-version owners for excluded enforcement and adapter work.
2. Positive Use Case/Handler and time examples now follow current canonical
   doctrine while explicit anti-pattern examples remain visibly negative.
3. Completed workflow discovery, historical template labeling, package install
   guidance, and requirement outcomes have explicit lifecycle truth.
4. Python discovery preserves literal manifest-governed commands, validates a
   usable 3.11+ interpreter, and retains required failure semantics.
5. The workflow commit range passes the repository commit policy after a
   subject-only repair of four unpublished local commits.

## Findings

| ID | Severity | Finding | Evidence | Impact | Recommendation | Owner / Next Skill |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| V042-001 | MEDIUM | Hosted Ubuntu has not executed the selected aggregate gate. | `.dev/workflows/2026-07-19-v0-4-2-remediation/evidence/platform-validation.md` records Windows pass and Ubuntu pending; current `.github/workflows/*.yml` do not run `check-all.sh`. | The interpreter fallback and SDK/tool availability are verified locally and synthetically but not on the required hosted platform. | Execute `.ai/scripts/check-all.sh --quick` at the pinned or explicitly superseding revision in an owner-approved hosted Ubuntu environment; do not add a new required CI route in v0.4.2. | `ai-context-governance` for evidence reconciliation; repository owner for external environment authorization |

## Baseline And Skill Comparison

### Confirmed

- Independent and repository-aware passes agree that hosted Ubuntu evidence is
  the only remaining material v0.4.2 verification gap.
- Both passes confirm that retained historical paths are labeled rather than
  silently deleted.

### Added By Repository-Aware Review

- The commit-range validator initially rejected four unpublished workflow
  subjects. Governance repaired only those subjects; the pinned subject now
  passes 6/6 commits.
- The patch-impact gate correctly assigns semantic enforcement, CI, template
  removal, adapter promotion, and runner redesign to named v0.5.0 items.

### Downgraded Or Deferred

- Physical auditor-template retirement is not a v0.4.2 defect after explicit
  historical labeling; it remains `ENF-001`.
- macOS is an accepted unverified platform pending an owner-arranged
  environment, not evidence of a failing implementation.

### Overturned

- `ASM-20260717-004` wrapper identity, routing omission, Handler doctrine,
  positive wall-clock, naming, connection-example, navigation, prompt-guide,
  install-path, source-residue, requirement-outcome, interpreter declaration,
  and advisory-root observations were not reproduced at the pinned revision.
- The earlier local SDK-unsatisfied observation is not current evidence:
  Windows Git Bash passed with .NET SDK `10.0.302`.

## Validation

| Check | Result | Evidence / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Git state | pass | clean `e76d89ca7927152cd993af7d53c3f0eb8a322384` used for the Windows gate |
| Registry and wrapper parity | pass | `validate-ai-context.py`; selected Claude Codex-only wording scan returned 0 |
| Path and reference checks | pass | workflow/assessment validators, exact-case and active-reference suites, active workflow table has one row |
| Schema / structured file parse | pass | AI-context, workflow, assessment, shell manifest, JSON, and YAML checks |
| Repository context checks | pass | Windows Git Bash quick gate: 21 selected, 21 executed, 21 passed, 0 failed/warnings |
| Commit range | pass | `validate-git-commits.py --range main..e76d89ca... --workflow-id 2026-07-19-v0-4-2-remediation`: 6 commits |

### Skipped Validation

- Hosted Ubuntu aggregate gate: pending external environment authorization.
- macOS: explicitly unverified by repository-owner decision.
- Full aggregate mode: not required for the selected v0.4.2 quick platform gate.
- Product source/test review: excluded by the AI-context audit boundary.

## Recommended Action Order

1. Run the pinned or explicitly superseding candidate on hosted Ubuntu with
   `.ai/scripts/check-all.sh --quick`.
2. Reconcile the exact Ubuntu revision, command, environment, and result into
   the workflow evidence.
3. Finalize this assessment if no new finding appears.
4. Close `R042-001` through `R042-004` and the remediation workflow; create a
   separate release-publication workflow only after owner authorization.

## Deferred Items

- `ENF-001`: semantic enforcement, governance CI, and published-path
  disposition.
- `SAG-001`: runtime adapter promotion and parity contract.
- `TOOL-001`: hosted evidence institutionalization and runner decision.
- `LANG-001`: v0.5.0 release-blocking translation debt.
- macOS platform evidence: separate owner-arranged environment.

```

### Notes

- The assessment is draft only because the required hosted Ubuntu evidence is
  absent. No high-severity content or tooling defect remains open.
- One package-apply symlink fixture skip is an explicit Windows privilege
  limitation; its required suite and aggregate gate passed.
