## Executive Summary

- Overall assessment: **local v0.4.2 finalization is healthy; one explicitly
  external publication correction remains**
- Overall score: **8.8/10**
- Decision: **healthy-with-followups**
- Primary strengths: the critical gate is green, release identity and authored
  sources are coherent, copied workflow evidence is corrected without history
  rewriting, roadmap/backlog truth is current, and external reviews now have a
  format-independent intake path.
- Primary risks: the public GitHub Release body still contains the invalid
  provenance SHA; `REL-001` and `HANDOFF-001` are planned rather than
  implemented.

The local hotfix is ready as a validated checkpoint. It must not be called
fully closed until the public Release body is explicitly authorized, replaced,
and read back successfully.

## Scope

### Included AI Context Surfaces

- Baseline assessment and preserved Fable evidence.
- v0.4.2 registry, authored notes, migration guide, release index, final
  annotated tag identity, and read-only hosted Release metadata.
- Original publication workflow corrections and successor hotfix artifacts.
- Roadmap, backlog, assessment intake policy, and repository validation gates.

### Default Exclusions

- `src/**`
- `tests/**`, `test/**` outside AI-context and tool-owned validation
- product implementation trees
- generated and dependency trees

### Additional Exclusions

- Public GitHub mutation.
- Published asset or tag changes.
- v0.5.0 enforcement implementation.

### Code Review Handoff

- Requested: `no`
- Paths not scanned: product source and product tests
- Recommended skill: not applicable

## Methodology And Evidence

### Pass A: Independent Baseline

- Recomputed release identity from the local annotated tag and required one
  coherent local registry, one authored notes source, non-empty migration
  guidance, and a green complete gate.
- Treated all correction claims as false until supported by current file
  content, validator output, or hosted read-back.
- Kept local remediation readiness separate from public Release mutation.

### Pass B: Repository-Aware Skill Review

- Applied assessment, workflow, backlog, version, release, commit, and
  AI-context evidence policies.
- Ran the full aggregate gate against the clean committed subject.
- Verified that post-tag R042-005 does not falsely claim
  `published_in: v0.4.2`.
- Confirmed REL-001, HANDOFF-001, and ENF-001 have distinct ownership.

### Delegation

- Sub-agents used: `no`
- Assigned surfaces: none; independent verification was performed by the main
  auditor pass without remediation edits.

### Discovery Accelerators

| Tool / generated view | Source revision or input digest | Freshness / dirty state | Scope and exclusions | Unsupported relationships | File-backed fallback |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| None | `895ce060b2287e6c6be6a5327496f6e763145891` | clean committed subject | targeted AI-context and release surfaces | not applicable | direct Git, files, validators, tests, and read-only GitHub API |

## Repository Context Inventory

| Surface | Files / Size | Audience | Scope | State | Notes |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Baseline and external evidence | 9 assessment files plus 7 raw files | maintainers/agents | finding truth | healthy | raw Fable package preserved verbatim |
| v0.4.2 release | registry, notes, guide, index | users/maintainers | release truth | locally healthy | public body correction pending |
| Workflow evidence | original publication plus successor hotfix | maintainers/agents | execution history | healthy with open external task | immutable Git history preserved |
| Roadmap/backlog | roadmap, index, 24 items | maintainers/agents | future work | healthy | REL/HANDOFF/ENF boundaries explicit |

## Strengths

1. `v0.4.2^{}` and `release.yaml#commit` both equal
   `f474c3b058cb9f89f93929e0732fc1f276422dd9`.
2. The release record is `published`; v0.4.2 is no longer an open governed
   candidate.
3. The authored release notes contain zero automation markers and zero rendered
   provenance headings; a dry-run render produces exactly one of each.
4. The migration guide is non-empty and accurately retains v0.3.0 as the only
   automatic source while deferring v0.4.0 to PKG-003.
5. Assessment, workflow, version, and AI-context validators pass, and the full
   aggregate gate executes all 21 required checks successfully.
6. External Fable analysis remains independent evidence under the normalized
   assessment instead of being rewritten into repository truth.

## Finding Reconciliation

| Baseline Finding | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ASM-20260720-001#AIC-001` | resolved | workflow validator passes for 26 post-adoption workflows and 24 backlog items |
| `ASM-20260720-001#AIC-002` | resolved | published registry, exact tag peel, version validator pass |
| `ASM-20260720-001#AIC-003` | partially resolved | local source and render dry-run pass; hosted body still contains one invalid SHA |
| `ASM-20260720-001#AIC-004` | resolved | migration guide contains 3,150 bytes of source-version guidance |
| `ASM-20260720-001#AIC-005` | resolved | historical mutable artifacts use correct workflow/run identities and retain incident facts |
| `ASM-20260720-001#AIC-006` | resolved | live roadmap/backlog records published v0.4.2 and active R042-005 |
| `ASM-20260720-001#AIC-007` | partially resolved | external intake contract and durable REL/HANDOFF items exist; mechanical implementation remains v0.5.0 |

## Baseline And Skill Comparison

### Confirmed

- Both passes confirm all local critical and high findings except the hosted
  body are repaired.
- Both passes confirm `R042-005` must not claim publication inside the earlier
  immutable tag.
- Both passes confirm future release and handoff execution requires mechanical
  gates, not more validation-shaped prose.

### Added By Repository-Aware Review

- Completed workflow tasks may record partial finding resolution when a
  successor workflow owns the explicit residual risk.
- The assessment policy can absorb arbitrary external report formats by making
  normalization a receiving-agent responsibility.
- The full aggregate gate is green even though public Release mutation remains
  deliberately out of scope.

### Downgraded Or Deferred

- The public body defect is no longer a local repository blocker, but it remains
  a release-finalization blocker requiring explicit authorization.
- Simplification work remains below REL-001 and HANDOFF-001 in priority.

### Overturned

- The original red critical gate, validated release status, empty migration
  guide, polluted local notes, copied run identity, and stale roadmap findings
  are no longer reproduced.

## Validation

| Check | Result | Evidence / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Full aggregate gate | pass | 21/21 required, 0 failed, 0 advisories, 4 deferred, 2 N/A |
| Analyzer template tests | pass | 49 passed |
| Configuration validation tests | pass | 2 passed |
| BuildingBlocks behavior tests | pass | 5 passed |
| Package apply GWT | pass with environment skip | 13 passed; one Windows symlink privilege fixture skipped |
| Assessment metadata | pass | 10 assessments before this verification artifact |
| Workflow/backlog metadata | pass | 26 workflows, 46 indexed directories, 24 items |
| Version and tag identity | pass | 7 release records; exact v0.4.2 tag peel |
| AI context | pass | 24 indexes, 14 canonical skills, 2 runtime roots |
| Authored release-body dry-run | pass | one marker, one provenance block, correct commit, no invalid SHA |
| Hosted Release read-back | follow-up required | stable non-draft release, 4 assets, one invalid SHA and one final SHA in current body |
| Git state | pass | clean committed subject `895ce060b2287e6c6be6a5327496f6e763145891` |

### Skipped Validation

- Public GitHub Release mutation was not authorized and therefore was not
  performed.
- macOS remains explicitly unverified from the v0.4.2 release scope.
- Product code review was excluded.

## Recommended Action Order

1. Commit this verification assessment and checkpoint the active workflow.
2. Obtain explicit authorization to replace only the public v0.4.2 Release body
   from the corrected local authored sources.
3. Read back the hosted Release and require invalid SHA count 0, final SHA count
   1, stable/non-draft state, and four unchanged assets.
4. Close R042-005 and advance the roadmap current target to v0.5.0.
5. Implement REL-001 and HANDOFF-001 before another release workflow is handed
   to a fresh or lower-cost executor.

## Deferred Items

- Public GitHub Release body correction.
- REL-001, HANDOFF-001, and aligned ENF-001 implementation.
- Fable simplification plan.
