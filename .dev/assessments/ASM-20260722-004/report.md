## Executive Summary

- Overall assessment: **all selected macOS portability findings are resolved**
- Overall score: **9.5/10**
- Decision: **healthy-with-followups**
- Primary strengths: host interpreter overrides are isolated without breaking
  fixture-owned overrides; exact source-tool prerequisites are explicit; active
  macOS evidence is attributed and bounded; historical truth remains unchanged.
- Primary risks: the receiving Windows host did not independently rerun macOS,
  and unavailable provider-native attribution fixtures remain out of scope.

No `CRITICAL`, `HIGH`, or `MEDIUM` release-readiness blocker remains.

## Scope

### Included AI Context Surfaces

- Baseline `ASM-20260722-003`, its raw external evidence, and all three findings.
- Exact remediation diff from `main` through `da70bb5`.
- Runner fixture behavior, prerequisites, publication runbook, active release
  notes, roadmap, TOOL-001, and v0.5.0 automatic source declarations.

### Default Exclusions

- `src/**`
- `tests/**`, `test/**` outside AI-context validation surfaces
- product implementation trees
- generated and dependency trees

### Additional Exclusions

- A second macOS execution by the receiving host.
- Provider-native attribution fixtures.

### Code Review Handoff

- Requested: `no`
- Paths not scanned: product source and product tests
- Recommended skill: not applicable

## Methodology And Evidence

### Pass A: Independent Baseline

- Inspected the frozen remediation commit without editing files.
- Required the host-inherited override to be removed before fixture-owned
  overrides, preserving both valid and invalid explicit override behaviors.
- Compared the current platform wording to the raw evidence and rejected any
  universal support or receiving-host rerun implication.

### Pass B: Repository-Aware Skill Review

- Applied assessment, workflow, historical-truth, release, and evidence-boundary
  contracts.
- Verified older final assessments and completed workflows are absent from the
  remediation diff.
- Verified all four exact automatic upgrade sources remain declared, including
  v0.4.2.

### Delegation

- Sub-agents used: `yes`
- Assigned surfaces: one bounded read-only low-cost verification of
  `ASM-20260722-003#AIC-001` through `AIC-003`; main agent retained evidence
  verification and final judgment.

### Discovery Accelerators

| Tool / generated view | Source revision or input digest | Freshness / dirty state | Scope and exclusions | Unsupported relationships | File-backed fallback |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| codebase-memory-mcp | `da70bb5db5cc2bb28fca7cdae54f6f1d3fc79b02` | frozen clean commit | Python fixture symbols | external execution and lifecycle semantics | direct diff, file reads, focused tests, and validators |

## Strengths

1. The correction removes only inherited state and applies explicit test-owned
   environment values afterward.
2. GWT coverage proves host overrides no longer contaminate fixtures while the
   valid and missing explicit-override contracts remain intact.
3. Documentation states the Python 3.11 and .NET SDK 10.0.300 floors and gives
   macOS an executable supported override path.
4. macOS evidence names the owner-arranged Fable host, architecture, native
   bash version, and pinned commit while rejecting universal claims.
5. Historical final assessments and completed workflows were not rewritten.

## Findings

| ID | Severity | Finding | Evidence | Impact | Recommendation | Owner / Next Skill |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| VFY-001 | none | `ASM-20260722-003#AIC-001` resolved. | inherited override is popped before explicit environment update; focused inherited, valid explicit, and invalid explicit cases pass | deterministic fixtures no longer depend on host override state | retain regression in the critical gate | `ai-context-governance` closure |
| VFY-002 | none | `ASM-20260722-003#AIC-002` resolved. | scripts README and runbook match `global.json` 10.0.300 baseline and Python 3.11 floor | clean hosts receive executable prerequisites | retain version consistency gate | `ai-context-governance` closure |
| VFY-003 | none | `ASM-20260722-003#AIC-003` resolved. | release notes, roadmap, and TOOL-001 use bounded owner-arranged attribution | active release truth no longer understates or overclaims macOS execution | preserve raw report and attribution qualifier | `ai-context-governance` closure |

## Baseline And Skill Comparison

### Confirmed

- All three baseline findings are resolved.
- v0.4.2 remains an exact automatic upgrade source.
- No historical final assessment or completed workflow was changed.

### Added By Repository-Aware Review

- The updated ROADMAP retains the original 2026-07-19 unverified decision and
  records its later owner-arranged closure as a dated amendment instead of
  rewriting historical truth.

### Downgraded Or Deferred

- Receiving-host macOS rerun is not required by the owner and is not a blocker.
- Provider-native attribution fixtures remain a separate explicit limitation.

### Overturned

- None.

## Validation

| Check | Result | Evidence / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Inherited override regression | pass | focused GWT passed |
| Explicit valid override | pass | `python3` fixture remains selected |
| Explicit missing override | pass | gate still fails closed |
| Complete fixture suite | pass | 27/27 normally and 27/27 with parent override |
| Critical gate | pass | 33/33 required, 0 failed, 0 deferred; 56 .NET tests passed |
| Four-source upgrade | pass | v0.3.0, v0.4.0, v0.4.1, and v0.4.2 real sources passed |
| Assessment/workflow/AI context/version | pass | all repository-native validators passed |
| Candidate release state | pass | candidate valid at `da70bb5` |
| Commit range | pass | 2/2 workflow commits valid before this assessment |

### Skipped Validation

- A receiving-host macOS rerun was explicitly not required.
- Provider-native runtime fixtures and real retained downstream repository input
  remain outside this workflow.

## Recommended Action Order

1. Persist this verification and reconcile the governance remediation ledger.
2. Pass hosted PR checks and merge to `main`.
3. Rerun the sanctioned pre-tag gate on current clean `main`.
4. Complete the explicitly owner-authorized immutable tag, hosted publication,
   and local release-registry finalization phases.

## Deferred Items

- Provider-native runtime fixtures remain explicit future work.

### Notes

- macOS execution remains attributed to the archived Fable 5 report.
- The independent sub-agent reported no blocker; the main agent verified its
  conclusions against file-backed evidence and executable gates.
