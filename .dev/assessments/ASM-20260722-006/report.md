## Executive Summary

- Overall assessment: all three `ASM-20260722-005` findings have a durable,
  discoverable, and appropriately bounded backlog disposition.
- Overall score: `9.6/10`
- Decision: `healthy-with-followups`
- Primary strengths: urgent hosted compatibility is a v0.6.0 blocker; optional
  metadata remains release-independent; legacy-target preservation fails closed.
- Primary risks: the backlog items are intentionally not implemented, and the
  private WorkService repository remains uninspected.

No intake or roadmap blocker remains. `CI-001` remains an implementation blocker
for the next release until a Node.js 24-native hosted run is proven warning-free.

## Scope

### Included AI Context Surfaces

- Baseline assessment `ASM-20260722-005`, retained external evidence, and all
  three findings.
- `CI-001`, `DEVWF-001`, `UPG-001`, backlog discovery, roadmap scheduling, and
  the intake workflow artifacts.

### Default Exclusions

- `src/**`, product tests, generated trees, and dependency trees.

### Additional Exclusions

- Implementation of the backlog items and inspection or upgrade of WorkService.

### Code Review Handoff

- Requested: `no`
- Recommended skill: not applicable.

## Methodology And Evidence

### Pass A: Independent Baseline

- Reviewed the frozen checkpoint commit and required each finding to have one
  explicit owner, scope boundary, acceptance contract, and roadmap disposition.
- Rechecked the external report's archived digest and hosted warning evidence.

### Pass B: Repository-Aware Skill Review

- Applied backlog, assessment, workflow, version, and upgrade-preservation
  contracts without broadening this planning intake into implementation.

### Delegation

- Sub-agents used: `yes`
- Assigned surface: bounded read-only review of mapping completeness and the
  retained evidence gap; the primary agent retained final judgment.

### Discovery Accelerators

| Tool / generated view | Source revision or input digest | Freshness / dirty state | Scope and exclusions | Unsupported relationships | File-backed fallback |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub Actions API evidence | run `29922585651` | immutable publication run | two warning annotations only | no future-run inference | retained JSON and workflow scan |

## Strengths

1. `CI-001` is explicitly assigned to v0.6.0 and blocks release until hosted
   warning-free evidence exists while preserving artifact-transfer semantics.
2. `DEVWF-001` treats issue references and lifecycle timestamps as optional or
   profile-controlled candidates, avoiding fabricated issue numbers.
3. `UPG-001` separates target-owned truth, framework-path overrides, and
   unresolved collisions; acknowledgement remains skip/preserve, not overwrite.
4. The external comparison is archived byte-for-byte with a narrow file-specific
   Git attribute, and the hosted warnings retain run/check IDs and commands.

## Findings

| ID | Severity | Finding | Evidence | Impact | Recommendation | Owner / Next Skill |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| VFY-001 | none | `ASM-20260722-005#AIC-001` is durably scheduled. | `CI-001`, roadmap v0.6.0 blocker, three exact call sites, retained annotations | next release cannot silently ignore the warning | activate `CI-001` before release work | governance |
| VFY-002 | none | `ASM-20260722-005#AIC-002` is durably deferred. | `DEVWF-001` defines optional issue and timestamp evaluation without a release assignment | design discussion can proceed without becoming a hidden v0.6.0 gate | activate independently when discussion capacity exists | dev-workflow plus governance |
| VFY-003 | none | `ASM-20260722-005#AIC-003` is durably deferred. | `UPG-001` requires rollback, provenance bootstrap, three-way classification, dry-run, and target validation | a customized legacy target has an executable preservation boundary | execute in the WorkService repository when authorized | upgrader plus governance |

## Validation

| Check | Result | Evidence / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Assessment artifacts | pass | all assessment locators and indexes valid |
| Workflow and backlog artifacts | pass | all workflow and backlog relationships valid |
| Backlog release contract | pass | 6/6 tests passed |
| AI context and versions | pass | repository-native validators passed |
| External evidence integrity | pass | working tree and staged Git blob identities matched; SHA-256 retained in baseline |
| Hosted warning attribution | pass | retained JSON contains run, check IDs, messages, scope, and reproduction commands |

### Skipped Validation

- No hosted action upgrade was run because implementation is outside this intake.
- WorkService was not inspected because the private target is outside this workspace.

## Recommended Action Order

1. Close and merge this intake workflow.
2. Activate `CI-001` before the next release workflow.
3. Discuss and activate `DEVWF-001` independently of release cadence.
4. Activate `UPG-001` before upgrading the private WorkService target.

## Deferred Items

- `CI-001`, `DEVWF-001`, and `UPG-001` implementation remain owned backlog work.
