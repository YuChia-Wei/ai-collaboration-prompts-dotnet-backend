# REL-v0.5.0 - Multi-Source, Runtime, Governance, And Release Safety

## Status

Release-ready governed candidate source. No tag or published commit exists.
Publication remains owner-authorized through a user-created annotated tag
after no-fast-forward merge and successful pre-tag preparation. Hosted checks
and independent successor verifications `ASM-20260722-002` and
`ASM-20260722-004` pass.

## Highlights

- Introduces migration schema `2.0.0`, binding each supported source version to
  its exact immutable files-manifest digest and deterministic operation set.
- Supports direct governed package upgrades from v0.3.0, v0.4.0, v0.4.1,
  and v0.4.2, plus an independently validated clean-install route.
- Promotes the context-translator sub-agent through explicit Codex, Claude, and
  GitHub Copilot adapter metadata while retaining dynamic loading as the
  default for other roles.
- Adds semantic thin-wrapper enforcement, exact published-path dispositions,
  and a dedicated read-only governance pull-request workflow.
- Adds deterministic offline dependency/version checks and proves the declared
  gate on Windows Git Bash, hosted Ubuntu, and an owner-arranged macOS arm64
  host using native bash 3.2.57.
- Adds deterministic agent-facing language-policy checks with retained
  bilingual structural parity and bounded semantic review evidence.
- Adds a machine-readable, fail-closed receiving checkpoint for cross-model,
  runtime, host, machine, and fresh-session continuation without rewriting
  provider-native Git attribution.
- Adds blank-value release templates, exact release-phase commands,
  pre-tag validation, a cold-start publication runbook, and hosted terminal
  checks so publication does not depend on hidden session context.

## Compatibility

This is a pre-1.0 minor release and intentionally changes the public migration
contract from schema `1.0.0` to `2.0.0`. Schema `1.0.0` packages remain
readable, while v0.5.0 packages publish multiple exact source-specific
operation sets.

The automatic sources are v0.3.0, v0.4.0, v0.4.1, and v0.4.2. A source version
and its exact published files manifest must both match one declared source;
ambiguous, partial, unknown, or mismatched identities fail closed.

Targets originating at v0.0.1 must first establish governed v0.3.0 provenance
through the retained manual v0.1.0 and v0.2.0 reconciliation path.

## Release Validation

Implementation checkpoints have verified four-source package behavior,
runtime-adapter parity, governance enforcement, dependency consistency,
Windows, hosted Ubuntu, and attributed macOS portability, language policy, and
receiving-handoff mechanics. The candidate passes its exact clean-state gate, two deterministic
four-source builds, hosted candidate CI, hosted governance, and hosted Ubuntu
quick validation. Independent assessment `ASM-20260722-001` found stale
release discovery and resume state; the workflow corrected those surfaces,
successor `ASM-20260722-002` verifies every selected finding resolved, and the
macOS portability successor `ASM-20260722-004` verifies the owner-arranged
evidence intake and fixture isolation with no new release-readiness blocker.

Known limitations:

- macOS execution was performed on the owner-arranged Fable 5 host at
  `9ac40bee4ab3d4ac169c05c6229895d7a22265ff`; the receiving Windows host did
  not repeat that platform run, and this evidence is not a universal support
  guarantee;
- online package currency and vulnerability state remain advisory rather than
  claims of the deterministic offline dependency gate;
- Copilot CLI, Copilot cloud-agent, and Claude native attribution fixtures
  remain explicitly unavailable, so no provider-specific identity rule was
  invented.

## Publication Completion

Publication has not occurred. Generated automation markers, public provenance,
tag peels, run IDs, release URLs, and asset digests belong to rendered output
or the finalized registry record, not this authored candidate source.
