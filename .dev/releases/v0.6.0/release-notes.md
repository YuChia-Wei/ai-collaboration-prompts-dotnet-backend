# REL-v0.6.0 — Componentized AI Context And Development Orchestration

## Status

Validated candidate.

## Highlights

- Defines one componentized release with mandatory software-development and
  AI-context lifecycle cores, the `dotnet-backend` profile, and an optional
  repository-backlog provider that defaults off for clean installations.
- Moves target provenance and semantic customization authority to
  `.dev/ai-context/provenance.yaml` and
  `.dev/ai-context/customizations.yaml`.
- Activates `software-development-orchestrator` and `ai-context-init` while
  retaining `dev-workflow` and `repo-structure-sync` as thin deprecated
  compatibility aliases with no scheduled removal.
- Preserves requirements, specifications, architecture, workflows, target-aware
  unit and integration testing, and selectable spec-compliance validation as
  first-class software-development capabilities.
- Introduces component-aware package metadata, deterministic upgrade planning,
  Terra model-in-the-loop release evidence, version-owned release gates, and
  Node.js 24-native hosted artifact transfer.

## Compatibility

v0.6.0 is a pre-1.0 breaking release. The automatic upgrade route accepts only
the exact published v0.5.0 package inventory. Existing component and backlog
selection is preserved and recorded; target-owned truth and semantic
customizations are reconciled rather than overwritten. Older releases must
first reach v0.5.0 through their published supported route.

## Release Validation

All v0.6.0 roadmap blockers, activation work, and simplification disposition
are resolved. Deterministic and target reconciliation suites passed, the
owner-selected Terra evaluation passed 8/8 critical and 8/8 full outcomes, and
PR #7 passed its hosted governance, Ubuntu, and candidate-discovery jobs before
merging to `main`. The independent candidate, current-main pre-tag, tag,
publication, and finalization gates remain mandatory.

## Publication Completion

Pending the user-created `v0.6.0` annotated tag and successful hosted
publication.
