# Migrate To v0.3.0

This guide applies to published release `REL-v0.3.0`. A target may claim `v0.3.0` only after its accepted package changes pass validation and its provenance records tag `v0.3.0` with commit `1e782909b7753b2889014516595d72f703a260f3`.

## Package Safety Sequence

Use the release archive as a versioned proposal, not as a whole-repository overwrite.

1. Preserve a rollback commit and require a clean target worktree.
2. Download either governed archive and its matching `.sha256` sidecar.
3. Use Python 3.11 or newer and install the pinned target-tool dependency from the extracted envelope with `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Validate the archive, member checksums, inventory, modes, and sidecar before inspecting a migration plan:

   ```text
   python .ai/scripts/validate-ai-context-package.py <archive>
   ```

5. Use `plan-ai-context-package-apply.py` in its default dry-run mode. Supply the previous governed `files.yaml` when upgrading so replacement, removal, and rename decisions can use previous released hashes. Keep any `--plan-output` outside both the extracted envelope and target repository.
6. Review every reconciliation item. Never acknowledge a conflict without determining whether the target or framework owns the truth.
7. Apply only from a clean worktree after the dry-run output is accepted. Pass every accepted reconciliation operation ID separately with `--acknowledge`, then add `--apply`:

   ```text
   python payload/.ai/scripts/plan-ai-context-package-apply.py --package-root . --target-root <target-repository> --previous-files <previous-files.yaml> --acknowledge <operation-id> --apply
   ```

   Acknowledgement preserves and skips the reconciled target path; it never grants overwrite or deletion permission.
8. Run `repo-structure-sync` after a clean installation, or `ai-context-upgrader` after a versioned upgrade.
9. Run target validation and write `.dev/AI-CONTEXT-SOURCE.yaml` only after the accepted payload and target-specific rewrites pass.

Framework-managed files may be replaced, removed, or renamed automatically only when their target bytes match the previous released hash. Target templates may be created only when absent. Target-owned truth and locally modified files always require reconciliation.

Archive validation alone does not authorize application to a target repository. Review and acknowledge reconciliation before applying the published package.

## From v0.2.0

1. Preserve a target rollback commit and verify the current source as `REL-v0.2.0` / `v0.2.0` / `9abc75b543ae201865c1e119d29fac2bcd2f4542` when possible.
2. Read the incoming version policy, upgrader skill, provenance contract, and this guide from the trusted framework registry.
3. Run the read-only comparison with `--target-root`; reconcile root entries, target-owned knowledge, changed wrappers, and local framework customizations.
4. Validate the `v0.3.0` archive. If a governed `v0.2.0` `files.yaml` baseline is available, supply it to the package planner for hash-gated operations; otherwise treat the target as a manual reconciliation source and do not infer managed-file ownership.
5. Apply accepted reusable framework paths only after all reconciliation items are acknowledged. Do not copy source workflow instances, assessment instances, backlog items, or `.dev/releases/` into the target.
6. Run `ai-context-upgrader` to reconcile target-owned context and create `.dev/AI-CONTEXT-SOURCE.yaml` from the canonical template. Record the published `v0.3.0` tag and full commit, framework deviations only, and any unresolved collisions.
7. Run target-mode version validation, AI-context validation, workflow validation when applicable, and the target's required repository gate.
8. Update provenance only after validation succeeds.

## From v0.1.0

First account for the `v0.1.0 → v0.2.0` reconciliation in the `REL-v0.2.0` migration guide, including root entries, assessment governance, workflow/commit policy, and slice remediation contracts. Then validate the `v0.3.0` package. Supply a governed `v0.1.0` `files.yaml` only when that version-specific baseline exists and matches the recorded release; otherwise use the upgrader's unresolved-provenance reconciliation path. Every intermediate breaking contract must remain visible in the plan.

## From v0.0.1

Treat `v0.0.1` as a confirmed source-snapshot identity, not a governed package
baseline. Verify that the target actually derives from
`ac2e2937b5209ece93e104c4a389a15e164c0d1b` and inventory the historical file
selection. When that selection or local history cannot be proven, enter the
upgrader's unresolved-provenance path rather than claiming byte-safe automatic
replacement.

Reconcile every intermediate change through `v0.1.0` and `v0.2.0`, including
root collaboration entries, skill/wrapper ownership, workflow and assessment
governance, language policy, testing conventions, version provenance, and
removed or renamed files. No v0.0.1 package inventory exists, so do not use
automatic remove, rename, or replace operations from path identity alone.

## From An Unversioned Or Forked Copy

Do not guess the base. Produce an unresolved-provenance inventory, identify a credible source tag/commit or manually reconcile the current target against the requested release, and preserve the decision as migration evidence. Only then create the provenance manifest.

The `v0.0.1` tag establishes source identity but not a target's installed file selection. Treat copies associated with that tag as unresolved provenance until the target selection and local changes are inventoried.

## Mandatory Reconciliation

- `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, translations, and root README identity.
- Target requirements, specs, ADRs, architecture, operations, domain language, and project configuration.
- Target catalog indexes for workflows, assessments, and backlog.
- Any locally modified canonical skill, runtime wrapper, script, or validation command.

An `automatic-candidate` remains a proposal until application is explicitly authorized.
