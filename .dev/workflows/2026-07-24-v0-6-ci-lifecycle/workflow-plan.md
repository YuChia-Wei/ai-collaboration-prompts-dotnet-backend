## Objective And Scope

- Execute `CI-001` and `CI-002` as one release-engineering workstream.
- Upgrade artifact actions to verified Node.js 24-native majors while preserving
  transfer semantics.
- Enforce the exact trigger, permission, concurrency, responsibility, cost, and
  mutation matrix for every active GitHub workflow.
- Remove stale concrete release literals from general governance.
- Preserve historical version-specific phase truth and give v0.6.0 its own
  independently addressable phase contract.

## Decision Boundary

The owner approved version-scoped phase contracts on 2026-07-24. The canonical
path is `.dev/releases/<version>/release-phase-checks.yaml`; the release-state
validator and release handoff checkpoint both resolve the selected stable
version and fail closed on missing, mismatched, or unsanctioned contracts.
Hosted warning-free artifact and concurrency evidence still requires a pull
request and an authorized publication rehearsal or real release.

## Stages

1. Apply the locally decidable workflow matrix and Node.js 24 action majors.
2. Add fail-closed static lifecycle contract tests and runner registration.
3. Record the release phase-contract and hosted evidence boundary.
4. Implement and locally validate version-scoped phase contracts.
5. Push the continuation branch with a durable handoff checkpoint.
6. After pull-request/publication authorization, collect hosted evidence and
   close.

## Branch Segments

| Segment | Branch | Base | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `codex/2026-07-24-v0-6-ci-lifecycle` | `codex/2026-07-24-v0-6-eval-deterministic` | Static four-workflow lifecycle and Node.js 24 action migration. |
| 2 | `codex/2026-07-24-v0-6-ci-phase-contract` | `codex/2026-07-24-v0-6-config-skill-transition` | Approved version-scoped release and handoff phase contract plus push checkpoint. |

## Resume Checkpoint

- Current task: `CIENG-001`.
- Exact next action: commit the validated version-scoped contract, create a
  push handoff checkpoint, and push segment 2.
- Blockers: hosted pull-request concurrency and publication execution remain
  outside the current push-only authorization.
- Git state: the static slice is committed at `b82ad4c`; segment 2 starts from
  `d64b909`.
