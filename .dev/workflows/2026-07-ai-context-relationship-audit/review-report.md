# AI Context Relationship Audit Report

## Evidence Used

- Root entry docs: `README.md`, `README.en.md`, `agents.md`, `agents.zh-tw.md`
- Governance standards: `.dev/standards/AI-CONTEXT-BOUNDARY.md`, `.dev/standards/AI-CONTEXT-LANGUAGE-POLICY.md`, `.dev/standards/WORKFLOW-GATE-POLICY.md`, `.dev/standards/GIT-COMMIT-POLICY.md`
- Canonical AI assets: `.ai/INDEX.MD`, `.ai/README.MD`, `.ai/DIRECTORY-RULES.MD`, `.ai/SUB-AGENT-SYSTEM.MD`, `.ai/assets/**`
- Runtime wrappers: `.agents/skills/**`, `.claude/skills/**`
- Project governance docs: `.dev/README.MD`, `.dev/INDEX.md`, `.dev/guides/**`, `.dev/specs/**`, `.dev/requirement/**`, `.dev/operations/**`, `.dev/workflows/**`
- Mechanical scans:
  - `rg --files -uu .ai .dev .agents .claude -g "*.md" -g "*.MD" -g "*.yaml" -g "*.yml" -g "*.json"`
  - targeted `rg -n -uu` searches for context paths, stale runtime roots, TODO markers, retired assets, and missing wrapper names
  - PowerShell referenced-path existence check over `.ai`, `.dev`, `.agents`, `.claude`, and root entry docs
- Sub-agent audits:
  - `.ai/**` canonical assets: score `76/100`
  - `.agents/**` and `.claude/**` runtime wrappers: score `94/100`
  - `.dev/**` governance and project knowledge docs: score `68/100`

## Overall Score

Overall AI context governance score: `76/100`.

Scoring weights:

- `.ai/**`: 40%
- `.dev/**`: 40%
- `.agents/**` and `.claude/**`: 20%

Reasoning: `.ai` and `.dev` carry canonical context, governance, and source-of-truth relationships. Runtime wrappers are important but intentionally thin and mostly synchronized.

## Boundary Hotspots

### 1. `.dev` Index And Directory Promises Are Stale

High impact relationship problems are concentrated in `.dev` entry and guide docs:

- `.dev/README.MD` advertises `lessons/`, but the directory is absent.
- `.dev/INDEX.md` points to absent paths such as `requirement/README-UML.md`, `requirement/requirement.md`, `lessons/`, `lessons/dotnet/`, and `legacy/ask/`.
- `.dev/specs/SPEC-GUIDE.MD` and `.dev/specs/SPEC-ORGANIZATION-GUIDE.MD` describe `.dev/specs/domains/` as the production-spec root, but that subtree is absent.
- `.dev/operations/*-GUIDE.MD` names canonical operation truth files such as `.dev/operations/context-map.md`, `.dev/operations/event-catalog.md`, and `.dev/operations/mq-topology.md`, but those files do not exist.

Action: `index-sync`, then either create explicit templates or rewrite these docs as guide-only placeholders.

### 2. `.ai` Agent-Facing Entry Docs Violate The Language Policy

The `.ai` layer is structurally coherent, but several agent-facing canonical docs are heavily Traditional Chinese mixed with English:

- `.ai/INDEX.MD`
- `.ai/README.MD`
- `.ai/DIRECTORY-RULES.MD`
- `.ai/SUB-AGENT-SYSTEM.MD`
- `.ai/assets/README.MD`
- `.ai/assets/skills/README.MD`
- `.ai/assets/sub-agent-role-prompts/README.MD`

This conflicts with `.dev/standards/AI-CONTEXT-LANGUAGE-POLICY.md`, which sets `.ai/**` default language to English.

Action: `rewrite` English canonical entry docs, and move human-facing zh-TW explanation to `.dev/guides/**` where needed.

### 3. Sub-Agent `human_guide` Fields Point Back Into `.ai`

The `.ai` sub-agent manifests use `human_guide: ".ai/SUB-AGENT-SYSTEM.MD"` across the sub-agent role prompt set. This is a relationship mismatch because the field name says human-facing guide, but the target is an agent-facing canonical `.ai` document.

Examples reported by the `.ai` audit:

- `.ai/assets/sub-agent-role-prompts/aggregate-code-review-sub-agent/sub-agent.yaml`
- `.ai/assets/sub-agent-role-prompts/problem-frame-sub-agent/sub-agent.yaml`
- `.ai/assets/sub-agent-role-prompts/controller-test-sub-agent/sub-agent.yaml`

Action: `rewrite` the field semantics or repoint to `.dev/guides/ai-collaboration-guides/**`.

### 4. `.ai/SUB-AGENT-SYSTEM.MD` Mixes Active Routing With Roadmap And Legacy Notes

The file is useful, but it mixes active canonical routing with migration notes and future assets:

- references retired `.ai/assets/commands/*`
- references future `reconciler-sub-agent/` as TODO
- contains active routing, artifact rules, and role inventory in one large surface

Action: `split` active canonical routing from roadmap or migration notes.

### 5. Runtime Wrappers Are Healthy But Have Drift Surface

The wrapper inventories are in sync:

- `.ai/assets/skills/README.MD`
- `.agents/skills/README.md`
- `.claude/skills/README.md`

All three expose the same 12 skill names. Wrappers are thin and English-only.

The only placement hotspot is duplicated runtime metadata:

- `.agents/skills/ddd-ca-hex-architect/agents/openai.yaml`
- `.claude/skills/ddd-ca-hex-architect/agents/openai.yaml`

Action: `keep`, with optional labeling or rehoming if this metadata becomes ambiguous.

## Recommended Actions

1. Fix `.dev` entry/index references first.
   - Update `.dev/INDEX.md` and `.dev/README.MD` so every advertised directory either exists or is explicitly labeled as a future/template placeholder.

2. Decide the `.dev/specs/domains/` contract.
   - If active production specs are expected, create the subtree and a README/template.
   - If not, rewrite spec guides to describe the current template-only state.

3. Reconcile `.dev/operations/` guide files with actual canonical files.
   - Either create target-repo template files for context map, event catalog, MQ topology, and runbook roots, or downgrade guide wording so it does not promise active operation truth.

4. Normalize `.ai` canonical entry docs to English.
   - Keep canonical agent instructions concise.
   - Move zh-TW explanatory/tutorial content into `.dev/guides/**`.

5. Repoint or rename sub-agent `human_guide` fields.
   - Use actual human-facing `.dev/guides/**` paths, or change the field to an agent-facing reference if the target remains `.ai/SUB-AGENT-SYSTEM.MD`.

6. Split `.ai/SUB-AGENT-SYSTEM.MD`.
   - Keep active sub-agent routing in the canonical file.
   - Move roadmap, TODO, and retired compatibility notes into a workflow record or guide.

## Deferred Items

- Historical workflow references under `.dev/workflows/**` intentionally mention retired scripts, removed source-project specs, old product artifacts, or migration targets. These should not be treated as active broken links unless the workflow is reopened.
- `.dev/project-config.yaml` is expected to be generated by `repo-structure-sync` in a target repository. References to it are acceptable when clearly optional or template-scoped.
- TODO-heavy .NET examples are not automatically context-boundary violations because this repository preserves a dotnet-backend template profile. They should be cleaned only as part of a dotnet-backend template readiness workflow.
- Runtime wrapper duplication across `.agents` and `.claude` is expected. It becomes a problem only if indexes or wrapper content drift from `.ai/assets/skills/**`.

## Validation

- Confirmed workflow mode requirement from `.dev/standards/WORKFLOW-GATE-POLICY.md`.
- Confirmed commit timing and validation expectations from `.dev/standards/GIT-COMMIT-POLICY.md`.
- Used hidden-directory scans with `rg -uu` so `.ai`, `.dev`, `.agents`, and `.claude` were included.
- Performed a referenced-path existence scan and classified expected generated/template paths separately from active broken references.
- No production code or repository content was changed outside workflow audit artifacts.
