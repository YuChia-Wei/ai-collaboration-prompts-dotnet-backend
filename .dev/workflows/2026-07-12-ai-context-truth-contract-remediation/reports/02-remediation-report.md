## Remediation Summary

- Authorized scope: remediate `CTX-H-001`, `CTX-H-002`, `CTX-M-001`, `CTX-M-002`, and `CTX-L-001` without scanning or changing product source/test code.
- Completed scope: four bounded tasks reclassified historical topology, parameterized active setup guides, established a validated wrapper metadata contract, aligned transient delegated-work routing, and corrected backlog documentation.
- Validation summary: targeted checks and task-level context gates passed; aggregate closure gates passed with 6/6 required quick checks, 9/9 wrapper metadata GWT tests, 47/47 analyzer tests, and 2/2 configuration tests.
- Closure decision: `ready`; the independent post-remediation audit confirmed all five findings resolved with no regression and rated the bounded scope `9.3/10`, `healthy-with-followups`.

## Finding Resolution Matrix

| Finding | Before Severity | Status | Changed Files | Validation | Commit | Residual Risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CTX-H-001` | HIGH | `resolved` | Project-structure owner and seven active consumers | Targeted active-truth/fixed-name searches; context/workflow validators | `3c6479b` | Target repositories must explicitly adopt any conditional physical topology. |
| `CTX-H-002` | HIGH | `resolved` | CORS, profile-based testing, and version/configuration placeholder guides | Stale-truth, source-name, fixed-profile, frontend-version, and credential searches; context/workflow validators | `af68027` | Adopting repositories remain responsible for supplying validated deployment and secret evidence. |
| `CTX-M-001` | MEDIUM | `resolved` | Canonical schema/template, ten migrated manifests, validator, tests, script guide | 9 GWT fixtures; Python compile; legacy-key search; context/workflow validators | `3be4f14` | Structural validation does not prove semantic equivalence of wrapper prose. |
| `CTX-M-002` | MEDIUM | `resolved` | `.ai/SUB-AGENT-SYSTEM.MD` | Targeted comparison with workflow gate; context/workflow validators | `97ec656` | Future routing edits must continue to reference the canonical workflow gate. |
| `CTX-L-001` | LOW | `resolved` | `.dev/backlog/README.MD` | Stale `.md` ownership search; backlog/workflow validator | `97ec656` | None beyond ordinary documentation drift. |

## Changes And Evidence

### `CTX-H-001`

- Changes: separated DDD/Clean Architecture invariants from an optional physical project-layout profile; replaced historical `Lab.*` naming and corrected `.ai`, `.agents`, and `.claude` responsibilities in active consumers.
- Evidence: `.dev/standards/project-structure.md`, `.dev/standards/README.md`, `.dev/ARCHITECTURE.md`, and the architect source map now require repository evidence or explicit adoption for physical topology.
- Validation: targeted active-truth and fixed-name searches returned no matches; AI context and workflow validators passed.
- Remaining risk: target repositories can still make an explicit profile choice that this framework does not validate semantically.

### `CTX-H-002`

- Changes: removed current-project assertions, MyScrum/database/frontend defaults, fixed test-profile claims, literal passwords, and hard-coded host paths; retained reusable CORS, fixture/DI, BDDfy/GWT, and placeholder-resolution guidance.
- Evidence: the three guides now require project files, explicit decisions, configuration sources, and secret references.
- Validation: targeted stale-truth, source-name, profile, frontend, and credential searches returned no matches; context and workflow validators passed.
- Remaining risk: target-repository adoption still needs local configuration and security review.

### `CTX-M-001`

- Changes: made `wrapper_path` the only canonical nested key; required exact metadata/target parity, mapping shape, repository-relative existing paths, and rejection of placeholders, globs, escape paths, and the legacy key.
- Evidence: all 13 canonical skills now conform; ten manifests were migrated; `.ai/scripts/tests/test_ai_context_wrapper_metadata.py` provides nine Given-When-Then regression cases.
- Validation: 9/9 fixtures passed, Python compilation passed, legacy-key search in manifests/template returned no matches, and aggregate context validation passed for 30 manifests.
- Remaining risk: validation deliberately remains structural rather than a prose-equivalence checker.

### `CTX-M-002`

- Changes: delegated artifact routing now defers to `WORKFLOW-GATE-POLICY.md` and explicitly permits conversation-only read-only multi-skill/stage/sub-agent analysis without repository artifacts or remediation.
- Evidence: `.ai/SUB-AGENT-SYSTEM.MD` contains the same persistence, mutation, artifact, and remediation boundary as the canonical policy by reference.
- Validation: targeted routing comparison passed; aggregate context validation passed.
- Remaining risk: duplicated summaries can drift if future edits stop projecting the canonical owner by reference.

### `CTX-L-001`

- Changes: corrected durable backlog ownership from `items/<item-id>.md` to `items/<item-id>.yaml`.
- Evidence: active backlog items and validation already use YAML.
- Validation: no stale `.md` ownership example remains in active AI-context/governance scope; workflow/backlog validation passed.
- Remaining risk: none identified.

## Post-Remediation Audit Reconciliation

- Independent auditor: `ai-context-auditor` sub-agent; final report at `.dev/workflows/2026-07-12-ai-context-truth-contract-remediation/reports/03-post-remediation-audit-report.md`.
- Confirmed resolved: `CTX-H-001`, `CTX-H-002`, `CTX-M-001`, `CTX-M-002`, and `CTX-L-001`.
- Recurring findings: none from the five-finding baseline scope.
- New or regressed findings: none. The auditor retained pre-existing coding-standard warnings, deferred dependency/version validation, and unasserted semantic parity as nonblocking follow-ups outside this remediation scope.

## Deferred Work

| Finding | Reason | Owner | Next Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| None from this remediation scope | All five baseline findings are remediated and independently verified. | `ai-context-governance` | Preserve the verified contracts during future maintenance. |

## Closure Evidence

- Required validations: `validate-ai-context.py`, `validate-workflow-artifacts.py`, `validate-shell-assets.py`, wrapper metadata GWT fixtures, and `check-all.sh --quick` passed. The quick gate selected and executed 6/6 required checks with zero failures; its existing 9 coding-standard warnings and one deferred dependency/version check are outside this remediation scope.
- Commit status: bootstrap `63d9b71`; remediation checkpoints `3c6479b`, `af68027`, `3be4f14`, and `97ec656`; this workflow closure commit contains both lifecycle reports and final state.
- Workflow/task status: `AICR-001` through `AICR-005`, the workflow, and backlog item `CTX-003` are completed/resolved.
- Final next action: merge the clean workflow branch with `--no-ff` when requested; no push is implied by closure.
