## Remediation Summary

- Authorized scope: adopt verified `v0.1.0` downstream installation feedback into source release, packaging, reference, commit, workflow, and tool-evidence governance without scanning product source or publishing a release.
- Completed scope: all nine `DSFB-*` recommendations received a source-backed resolution or explicit framework boundary; copied feedback remains immutable evidence.
- Validation summary: targeted GWT suites, context/workflow/version/package/shell validators, actual archive build/parity, selected commit-range validation, and quick aggregate gates passed at their recorded checkpoints.
- Closure decision: `ready-with-deferrals`

## Finding Resolution Matrix

| Feedback Finding | Before Severity | Status | Changed Files | Validation | Commit | Residual Risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `DSFB-P0-001` source snapshot versus installable distribution | P0 | resolved | `.dev/releases/v0.1.0/**`, `.dev/releases/v0.2.0/**`, version validator/tests | 14 version GWT; three release records | `c0b3407` | Historical tags remain provenance anchors, not installable packages. |
| `DSFB-P0-002` governed builder and safe application | P0 | resolved | distribution profile and package reference-integrity gate | actual ZIP/tar build, validation, and parity | `66f3173` plus prior release workflow | Windows symlink negative fixture remains skipped without host privilege. |
| `DSFB-P0-003` validator extension and aggregate parity | P0 | resolved | shell registry/validator, aggregate gate, lifecycle tests | 17 runner/registry GWT; set parity | `ba97e7f` | Manifest and runner remain duplicated declarations; parity detects one-sided drift but not omission from both. |
| `DSFB-P0-004` executable commit policy | P0 | resolved as explicit gate | commit policy YAML, validator, GWT, conditional gate | 8 GWT; `main..HEAD` validation | `361977e` | Enforcement requires an explicit `COMMIT_RANGE`; authorship cannot be inferred safely. |
| `DSFB-P1-001` source lifecycle install leaks | P1 | resolved | package profile/reference gate and source script documentation | 11 packaging GWT; actual package validation | `66f3173` | Generic lifecycle placeholders remain allowed by design. |
| `DSFB-P1-002` exact-case active references | P1 | resolved | context validator, 17 source documents, GWT | 5 exact-case GWT; context validator | `4f1bcca` | This is exact-case validation, not a universal missing-link crawler. |
| `DSFB-P1-003` workflow metadata semantics | P1 | partially resolved prospectively | workflow validator, templates, policy, GWT | 6 lifecycle GWT; current corpus | `ba97e7f` | Critical in-progress/completed contradictions are enforced; less-used planned/blocked/cancelled transitions and content-to-timestamp change proof remain outside the current snapshot validator. |
| `DSFB-P1-004` graph freshness | P1 | resolved at framework boundary | evidence policy, auditor playbook/report template | live graph miss compared with Git-present file; context validator | `4bcd670` | External tools own re-index mechanics and freshness UX. |
| `DSFB-P2-001` generated inventory drift | P2 | resolved | generated-inventory contract and retired-generator header correction | active marker scan; context/shell validators | `4bcd670` | No active generated inventory exists, so regeneration parity is not applicable. |

## Changes And Evidence

### Distribution And Installation

- Historical v0.1/v0.2 records now declare `source-snapshot-only` and `installable: false`.
- The governed package profile rejects concrete backlinks into excluded workflow, assessment, release, and backlog-instance paths.
- An actual v0.3 candidate ZIP and tar.gz were built from immutable Git-tree bytes and passed cross-format parity; no tag or release was created.

### Active Context Integrity

- Git-tracked casing is now authoritative for recognized internal root-relative, Markdown, and relative references.
- The first source run repaired 28 active mismatches, including architecture and requirement/spec guide references.
- The context validator remains file-backed and does not depend on an optional graph.

### Commit And Workflow Governance

- Explicitly selected AI-assisted commits fail on invalid subject, final AI trailer, assessment identity, workflow body sections, or workflow identity.
- Required literal aggregate commands and shell children are compared as declared sets rather than fixed counts.
- Workflow locator template `1.2.0` opts into lifecycle contract `1.0`; legacy records remain unchanged.

### Tool And Generated View Boundary

- A live codebase-memory query did not find the newly added `validate_commits` node while Git and the filesystem contained the validator, directly demonstrating staleness risk.
- Audit reports now record accelerator revision/digest, freshness, scope, omissions, unsupported relationships, and file-backed fallback.
- Generated inventories retained as artifacts must declare provenance and reproducibility; none is created merely for convenience.

## Verification Assessment Reconciliation

- Independent auditor: bounded read-only sub-agent review of `main..HEAD`, all `DSFB-*` findings, workflow state, and required validators.
- Confirmed resolved: `DSFB-P0-001`, `DSFB-P0-002`, `DSFB-P0-003`, `DSFB-P0-004` as an explicit gate, `DSFB-P1-001`, `DSFB-P1-002`, `DSFB-P1-004`, and `DSFB-P2-001`.
- Recurring findings: none.
- New or regressed findings: none; reviewer downgraded `DSFB-P1-003` to partial prospective resolution and required conditional commit-gate wording.

## Deferred Work

| Finding | Reason | Owner | Next Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| External graph incremental re-index UX | Outside repository and vendor-neutral framework ownership. | Tool provider / local environment owner | Re-index or expose freshness metadata in the selected tool; always retain file-backed fallback. |
| Windows symlink escape fixture | Host lacks symlink creation privilege; other package safety fixtures pass. | Environment owner | Run the same GWT on a privileged Windows or Unix CI host when release CI is exercised. |
| Full workflow state-machine and content-to-timestamp proof | Current validator targets critical adopted states; proving every content change requires historical/diff-aware validation and status-specific policy. | `ai-context-governance` | Expand only when planned/blocked/cancelled states become active operational requirements. |
| Unavoidable commit-policy invocation | Human-only versus AI-assisted authorship is not safely inferable. | Workflow owner / CI caller | Set `COMMIT_RANGE` and `WORKFLOW_ID` during AI-assisted closeout or CI. |

## Closure Evidence

- Required validations: independent review reproduced workflow/context/version/shell checks, 8 commit messages, 25 packaging/apply tests with one environment skip, 47 analyzer tests, 2 configuration tests, and the quick gate; final closure-state gates are recorded in AICFB-008.
- Commit status: implementation checkpoints through `4bcd670` are committed; final closure commit pending.
- Workflow/task status: all tasks completed after independent reconciliation; locator and index closed in the same change.
- Final next action: commit the closeout, then validate the resulting commit range and confirm a clean worktree. Merge, push, tag, and release remain unauthorized.
